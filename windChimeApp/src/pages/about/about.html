    <p>
    Your chime will not chime when it's too dark (to let you sleep peacefully) or if 
    that's too noisy (for not disturbing your nice music listening session).
    </p>
    <p> 
    Well, it's not very smart, but it remembers how much light and sound it is used to see, 
    so it adapts itself to season and environments variations to detect night/day.
    </p>
    <p>
    You teach your chime when it should not have considered it is dark.

    Your Chimuino contains:
    <ul class="my-nav">
      <li>an Arduino (Arduino Uno R3), that is an open hardware programmable chip belonging a large community and ecosystem</li>
      <li>a stepper engine (BYJ48) that moves quietly the Chime to ring it, and the associate controller</li>
      <li>a photovoltaic diod for measuring the light level</li>
      <li>a basic microphone able to measure the level of sound</li>
      <li>a real time clock (RTC DS3231) so alarms ring when expected</li>
      <li>a bluetooth (HM-10 Bluetooth-4.0 V2 based on the TI CC2541 chip) to communicate with a smartphone or tablet</li>
      <li>a software in version: {{chimuino.firmwareVersion}}</li>
    </ul>

  For support or suggestions of improvement, <a href="https://github.com/samthiriot/windchime/issues">please contact the community</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  You're free to enhance the software of this project, both the software into the Chimuino and the smartphone application. 
  Both are open-source. Fork them, update your Arduino or app, do what you wish; this product is yours. 
  We just ask you to give back this result to the community. Of course, if you break it, we cannot support you anymore.
  </p>
  <p>
  You will find everything in our github repository <a href="https://github.com/samthiriot/windchime/issues">github.com/samthiriot/windchime</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you wish to tune the hardware, you're welcome to do it too! Just be careful to your safety and the safety of people around... and enjoy. 
  Of course, should you break you product, that would be your responsibility only.

  We try to lower ecologic footprint by working on ecodesign. 
  It includes reducing the energy consumption, design for disassembly and avoiding obsolescence.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Energy consumption</b> is a permanent effort. 
  We chose the Bluetooth Low Energy technology which is much more energy efficient for data transmission.
  We use the technical possibilities by disabling useless features: the stepper engine in free wheel as soon as possible, 
  we activate Arduino power sleep mode, and disabled useless Real-Time-Clock features.
  </p>

  <p>
  We <b>designed Chuimuino for disassembly</b>. If you don't want this product anymore or it is broken beyond repair, 
  you can open it with standard tools. You can reuse the standard electronic parts for DIY projects, or donate them to a local electronics club. 
  See the hardware list below (TODO).
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Obsolescence</b> of this product is neither planned nor built-in! 
  If we cannot support this product anymore by ourself, you or third-party might do it. 
  We used standard on-the-shelf hardware components, so you should be able to find spare parts without our help. 
  The software is opensource, so anyone (able to develop) can upgrade it when required.

  <p>
  The bluetooth connection is encrypted, and is only broadcasted about 100m away. 
  The only information the Chuimuino knows about you is light level, noise level, temperature, 
  and alarms. So it's likely no one will take the troube to hack the device to spy you.
  </p>

  <p>
  To be entirely secure, you can just switch the bluetooth off on the device using the switch. 
  </p>

  <p>
  This device is so simple it cannot, by design, collect too much sensitive information nor transmit it.
  So even if a pirate was able to hack your device or our servers, s/he would not be able to access a lot of sensitive information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The microphone is only able to measure a level of noise (more or less noisy)</li>
    <li>The light sensor is only able to measure a level of light</li>
    <li>The chips embbeded in the Chimuino are so simple they cannot do a lot</li>
    <li>The only way information would be transmitted is through bluetooth</li>
  </ul>

  What can others learn of your private life through this device? Here are a few attack scenarii:
  <ul>
    <li>The fact the device is on or off can be detected by anyone nearby who will see the bluetooth device.</li>
    <li>Accessing the state of the device (alarm defined, your place being lit or dark) can be done by going over the bluetooth security.
        It probably might be done by a pirate trying the one million possible pin codes (brute force attack).
        It might be done either by breaking the encryption (AES-128) implemented in the bluetooth chip. As any encryption, 
        it might be broken if someone has enough interest in the limited information we listed before.</li>
    <li>a pirate might install a spyware by physically accessing your device (that would be complicated on these very simple chips).
        If they do that, they might be able to know how much light or noise there is in your place, when you intend to wake up, what 
        the temperature is, and brodcast that information through bluetooth (100meters range).</li>
  </ul>
