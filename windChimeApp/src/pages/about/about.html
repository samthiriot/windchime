<h3><ion-icon name="lock"></ion-icon> Privacy</h3>

<p>
This device is so simple it cannot, by design, collect private information nor transmit them.
So even if a pirate was able to hack your device or our servers, he would not be able to access any type of private information.

The microphone is a simple device which is only able to measure the level of noise, but can not technically record any voice.
